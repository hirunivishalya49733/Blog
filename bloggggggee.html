    <h1>The Rise of Technology - Augmented Reality vs Virtual Reality </h1>
    <h2>Virtual Reality</h2>

 <p class="paragraph">Virtual reality is a fully digital, computer generated, three ddimensional experiential environment. Simply in virtual reality, the world you're standing in is replaced with a virtual one. Everything
you see and hear is something computer generated.</p>

<p>You can be interact with an artificial yet very naturalistic or extremely synthetic three dimensional
environment using electronic devices such as special goggles with a screen or gloves fitted with
sensors. Virtual reality uses VR headsets to create simulator environment and helps an
individual to immerse into it to experience an entirely different reality.</p>




<h3>Mainly there are 3 types of Virtual Reality</h3>
<ol>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Non-immersive VR</li>
<li>Non-immersive VR</li>
<li>Fully-immersive VR</li>
</ul>
</ol>



<h2>What is Non Immersive virtual reality?</h2>

<p>Non immersive virtual reality is where you can control some characters or activities within the
experience, but the virtual environment is not directly interacting with you.
Non immersive virtual reality provides you a computer generated environment but you don't feel
being immersed in the virtual world. That means you can control the characters or activities
within the experience without the virtual environment directly interacting with you.</p>

<i><b>Main difference between immersive and non immersive virtual reality is in the 3D content
delivery method.</i></b>

<h2>What is Semi Immersive virtual reality?</h2>

<p>Semi-immersive virtual reality allows the isers to experience virtual 3-dimensional environments
while remaining connected to real world surrounding visuals, auditory, smells and haptics as
well as keeping control over physical objects.
Semi-immersive VR is something in between non immersive and fully immersive virtual reality.
You will only get the ability to move around in a virtual environment using a computer screen or
vr glasses, so you can't experience any physical sensation other than your visual experience in
the computer generated environment.</p>


<h3>Key elements of Semi-immersive VR</h3>
<ol>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Realistic 3D virtual environment</li>
<li>Haptic feedback</li>
<li>High quality sound properly synchronized with a digital image</li>
<li>Advanced hard simulator</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<h2>What is Fully Immersive virtual reality?</h2>

<p>Fully immersive virtual reality is the presentation of an artificial environment that replaces users'
real world surroundings convincingly enough that they are able to suspend disbelief and fully
engage with the created environment.</p>

<p>Simply fully immersive virtual reality allows users to experience artificial environment as the real
world. Unlike semi-immersive vr, where users retain a strong connection to the real world but
fully immersive virtual environment users are completely isolated from the physical
surroundings. Users can't interact with the real world objects. Instead using head mounted
display and using wireless controllers, they can explore digital 3D environment and interact with
the computer generated environment.</p>

<h2>Augmented Reality</h2>

<p>Augmented reality is an enhanced vision of the real physical world that is achieved through the
use of digitak visual elements, sound or other sensory stimuli delivered via technology.
Augmented reality brings digital information and virtual objects into the physical space.
Augmented reality is a technology that projects computer generated on top of reality, helping an
individual to perform tasks better and efficiently.</p>

<i><b>AR falls in between reality and virtual reality.</b></i>

<p>AR is also known as mixed reality. Main purpose of AR is not to cut out the real world and
transport to another one but rather is to be an enhancement of the real world with a set of
magical virtual objects in it.
When a persons' real environment is supplimented or augmented with computer generated
images usually motion tracked, thrn that's augmented reality. </p>
